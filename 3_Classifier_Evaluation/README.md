# Classifier Evaluation [x]



Decision Tree vs Naive Bayes :
        A program to implement Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Classifier and perform a classification task. 
A template to generate data : as: Ɗ(x,y) where x is a 2 dimensional input → x =[x1, x2] ~ U(-1,1) x U(-1,1) and y = sign (x12 + x22 - 0.5) where U denotes Uniform Distribution.
I have generated an appropriate number of samples such that I was able to learn the classifier.
For each of the above classifiers, I have performed k-fold cross validation and plotted the train and test accuracy (y-axis) with varying ‘k’ (1<=k<=10) (x-axis). 

Libraries : Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn
