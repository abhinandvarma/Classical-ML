# SVM [x]



SVM :
       A program to implement SVM classifier on UCI breast cancer dataset to perform the classification task.  The dataset is split into 70:30 as train and test dataset. 
a. svm_models() : to implement SVM models with different kernels and bar plot the test accuracy.
b. ploy_kernel_var_deg() : to implement SVM with polynomial kernel and plot the execution time w.r.t. the degree of the polynomial ranging from 1 to 3.
c. custom_kernel() : to implement a custom kernel which is of the form K(X,Y)= k*XYT+θ, where k and θ, are constants.
d. svm_custom_kernel() : to implement SVM classifier with the above defined custom kernel and report the test accuracy.  

Libraries : Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
