# SVD and Low Rank Approximation for Movie Recommender system[x]
A project to predict the rating of unrated movies from a dataset containing large samples of ratings from users for different movies. The project uses dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of redudant features and understand an underlying pattern.

I've used Spectral Value Decomposition to reduce the high dimensional matrix into its components and Low Rank Approximation to extract important features of 20.
